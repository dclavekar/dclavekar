### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Dhanashree Lavekar!  
I am a Second year undergraduate from Pune Institute of Computer Technology pursuing Information technology Engineering. I am a full stack Web developer who is cultivating interest in Competetive programming. I look forward to use my skills and develop softwares that can solve or help in dealing with real-life problems.  
Apart from learning technology, you can find me indulged in nature, dancing to the tunes of music, engulfed in some fictional world of books or narrating a story through my words.
